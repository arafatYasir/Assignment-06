    <h1>Answers</h1>
    <h3>Ans: The scope of var variable is global scope. The scope of both let and const is block scope.</h3>
    <h3>Ans: Null means I have something with no data or value. On the other hand, undefined means I have nothing defined. Which means that doesn't exist actually. When I have to show that there is nothing then I will use null. But when there is nothing defined then I will use undefined.</h3>
    <h3>Ans: An API is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. In other words, if you want to interact with a computer or system to retrieve information or perform a function, an API helps you communicate what you want to that system so it can understand and fulfill the request. REST is a set of architectural constraints, not a protocol or a standard. REST stands for representational state transfer.</h3>
